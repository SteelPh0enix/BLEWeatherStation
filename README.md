# BLEWeatherStation
Simple BLE weather station, made using ST components

## Components used

- Nucleo-G474RE - as main board
- X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1 - BLE shield, with BlueNRG-M2SP module
- X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 - MEMS shield, connected to Nucleo board with 4 cables, since it doesn't really want to work as shield sandwich with BNRG2A1 and i couldn't troubleshoot it in one day, so i gave up.
